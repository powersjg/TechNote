\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction_chap}
The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is
an atmospheric modeling system designed for both research and numerical 
weather prediction.  WRF is an open-source community model, and has been 
adopted for research at universities and governmental laboratories, 
for operational forecasting by governmental and private entities,
and for commercial applications by industry.  WRF took shape in the latter 
half of the 1990's with the ideas of building a system shared by research 
and operations and of creating a next-generation NWP capability moving 
past existing limitations.  The new model would be a 
common platform on which the broad research community 
could develop capabilities that could transition to operations, 
while the extra scrutiny of performance in operations
could guide and accelerate development.  The WRF system was developed
through a partnership of the National 
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) (represented by the National Centers for Environmental 
Prediction (NCEP) and, currently, the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL)), 
the United States Air Force, the Naval Research Laboratory, the 
University of Oklahoma, and the Federal Aviation Administration.  
Since the mid-late 2000's, a top-down management structure 
of the original partners has shifted to NCAR being responsible for system 
oversight and support, with developments reflecting community input. 

WRF consists of flexible, modular, portable code that is 
efficient in computing environments ranging from laptops to 
massively-parallel supercomputers and is readily-configurable for 
a variety of applications.  Its extensive menu of physics
and dynamics options reflect wide community input
and make it a powerful NWP tool.  WRF has a data assimilation system (WRFDA)
that offers a variety of DA approaches and can ingest a spectrum of 
observation types.  In addition, for earth system prediction needs 
beyond basic weather forecasting, WRF supports a number of tailored capabilities.  
These include WRF-Chem (atmospheric chemistry), 
WRF-Hydro (hydrological modeling), WRF-Fire (wildland fire modeling), 
and WRF-Solar (solar energy forecasting).

WRF is supported as a community model, facilitating system development
and broad use for research, operations, and education.  It supports  
atmospheric simulations across scales from large-eddy to global.  
WRF's applications include real-time NWP, weather event and 
atmospheric process studies, data assimilation development, 
parameterized-physics development, regional climate simulation, air 
quality modeling, atmosphere-ocean coupling, and idealized-atmosphere studies.  

Figure 1.1 depicts the principal components of the WRF system. 
The WRF Software Framework (WSF) is the infrastructure 
that contains the dynamics solvers, physics packages, utilities
for initialization, WRFDA, and integrated capabilities such as WRF-Chem.  
Within the WSF there are two dynamics solver options: the 
Advanced Research WRF (ARW) solver (originally referred to
as the Eulerian mass or $``$em" solver) developed primarily at NCAR, and
the NMM (Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model) solver developed at NCEP.
The Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Laboratory of NCAR provides
support for the ARW, and oversees the WRF repository and releases.
This document describes the ARW (Version 4) and the system components 
shared by both solvers.

\section {Advanced Research WRF (ARW)}

The ARW is a configuration of the WRF system featuring
the ARW dynamics solver together with other compatible components 
to produce a simulation.  Thus, 
it is a subset of the WRF system that, in addition to the specific solver, 
encompasses physics schemes, numerics/dynamics options, 
initialization routines, and a data assimilation package (WRFDA).  
The ARW solver has the WSF in common with the NMM solver and all other 
WRF components within the framework.  While physics packages are 
largely shared by both the ARW and NMM solvers, specific 
compatibility varies with the schemes considered.  
Note that the association of a component of the WRF system with 
the ARW does not preclude the component from being in
WRF configurations that use the NMM solver.  
The following section highlights the major features of the 
ARW, Version 4, first released in June 2018.

This technical note focuses on the scientific and algorithmic 
approaches in the ARW, including the solver, physics options,
initialization capabilities, boundary conditions, and grid-nesting techniques.  
The WSF provides the software infrastructure.  
WRFDA, the data assimilation system for WRF, was  
originally adapted from the MM5 
(Pennsylvania State University--NCAR Mesoscale Model 5) 
3DVAR (3-dimensional variational data assimilation) system 
\citep{barker04} and is part of the ARW.
While WRF-Chem and other tailored systems 
(e.g., WRF-Hydro, etc.) use the ARW solver, they are 
not covered by this technical note.  Those seeking details on 
WRF-Chem may consult \citet{Grelletal05} and 
https://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/wrf-chem/.  Furthermore, for information on 
actually running the ARW system, the ARW Version 4 Modeling System User's Guide 
(http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/user_guide_V4/WRFUsersGuide.pdf) 
covers model operation.
