\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction_chap}
The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is
a numerical weather prediction (NWP) and atmospheric simulation 
system designed for both 
research and operational applications.  WRF is supported 
as a common tool for the university/research and operational 
communities to promote closer ties between them and to 
address the needs of both.  The development of WRF has been a 
multi-agency effort to build a next-generation mesoscale forecast model 
and data assimilation system to advance the understanding and prediction 
of mesoscale weather and accelerate the transfer of research 
advances into operations.  The WRF effort has been a collaborative one 
among the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) 
Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology (MMM) Division, the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 
(NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and 
Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL), the Department of Defense's 
Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), 
the Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS) at the University 
of Oklahoma, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), 
with the participation of university scientists. 

WRF reflects flexible, state-of-the-art, portable code that is 
efficient in computing environments ranging from massively-parallel
supercomputers to laptops. 
Its modular, single-source code can be configured for both 
research and operational applications.  Its spectrum of physics
and dynamics options reflects the experience and input of the 
broad scientific community.  Its WRF-Var variational data assimilation 
system can ingest a host of observation types in pursuit of 
optimal initial conditions, while its WRF-Chem  
model provides a capability for air chemistry modeling.

WRF is maintained and 
supported as a community model to facilitate wide use internationally, 
for research, operations, and teaching.
It is suitable for a broad span of applications across 
scales ranging from large-eddy to global simulations.  Such applications 
include real-time NWP, data assimilation 
development and studies, parameterized-physics research, regional 
climate simulations, air quality modeling, atmosphere-ocean coupling, and 
idealized simulations.  As of this writing, 
the number of registered WRF users exceeds 6000, and WRF is in 
operational and research use around the world.

The principal components of the WRF system are depicted in Figure 1.1. 
The WRF Software Framework (WSF) provides the infrastructure 
that accommodates the dynamics solvers, physics packages 
that interface with the solvers, programs for initialization,   
WRF-Var, and WRF-Chem.  There are two dynamics solvers in the WSF: the 
Advanced Research WRF (ARW) solver (originally referred to
as the Eulerian mass or $``$em" solver) developed primarily at NCAR, and
the NMM (Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model) solver developed at NCEP.
Community support for the former is provided by the MMM Division of NCAR 
and that for the latter is provided by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC).

\section {Advanced Research WRF}

The ARW is the ARW dynamics solver together with other
components of the WRF system compatible with that solver and 
used in producing a simulation.  Thus, it is a subset of 
the WRF modeling system that, in addition to the ARW solver, 
encompasses physics schemes, numerics/dynamics options, 
initialization routines, and a data assimilation package (WRF-Var).  
The ARW solver shares the WSF with the NMM solver and all other 
WRF components within the framework.  Physics packages are 
largely shared by both the ARW and NMM solvers, although specific 
compatibility varies with the schemes considered.  
The association of a component of the WRF system with 
the ARW subset does not preclude it from being a
component of WRF configurations involving the NMM solver.  
The following section highlights the major features of the 
ARW, Version 3, and reflects elements of WRF Version 3, 
which was first released in April 2008.

This technical note focuses on the scientific and algorithmic 
approaches in the ARW, including the solver, physics options,
initialization capabilities, boundary conditions, and grid-nesting techniques.  
The WSF provides the software infrastructure.  
WRF-Var, a component of the broader WRF system, was  
adapted from MM5 3DVAR \citep{barker04} and is encompassed within the ARW.
While WRF-Chem is part of the ARW, Version 3, it is described 
outside of this technical note.  Those seeking details on 
WRF-Chem may consult \citet{Grelletal05} and 
http://ruc.fsl.noaa.gov/wrf/WG11/status.htm . 
For those seeking information on running the ARW system, 
the {\wrf} User's Guide \citep{wang08} 
has the details on its operation.
